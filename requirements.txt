# Democrazy Meta-Agent Requirements
# Self-Assembling AI System for NLP2SQL

# Core Python packages (most should be available in standard library)
# No external dependencies required for basic functionality!

# Optional database connectors (install if needed):
# psycopg2-binary>=2.9.0    # For PostgreSQL support
# pymysql>=1.0.0            # For MySQL support

# The system is designed to work with:
# - Python 3.8+
# - Standard library modules: asyncio, sqlite3, json, logging, datetime, uuid, random
# - No external AI/ML dependencies required!

# For enhanced functionality, you may optionally install:
# requests>=2.25.0          # For real HTTP API connections
# numpy>=1.21.0             # For advanced numerical computations
# pandas>=1.3.0             # For data analysis capabilities

# Note: The system demonstrates emergent intelligence using only
# Python standard library - no heavy ML frameworks needed!
